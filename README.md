An iOS application for QR scanning and storing scanned data to Firebase Cloud Firestore

This is an assignment for iOS Mobile App Development module as a part of my course BSc in Information Technology with specialism in Mobile Technology in Asia Pacific University.

This application is developed using Firebase, CocoaPods, Swift 4.1 and Xcode 9.4.
The application is able to allow user to sign-in with Facebook, Google or email and password.
The scanned data are all stored in Cloud Firestore.

A demo of the application is available here: https://youtu.be/qssA1fOlf8I
